# Weather Data Web Scraper

This is a simple web scraper I created in undergraduate. I was taking a general education course called "Earth as a System", and we were given an assignment in which
we were tasked with collecting weather data for our hometown from a particular website that used NOAA data, for the months of September and October. Being a growing
computer science student at the time, I thought it would be a fun opportunity to practice python and learn about web scraping.


The script uses the selenium framework for python to pull data from the page, and writing it to an excel spreadsheet. The date information for the website is located
in the url, so it creates a list and iterates through the URLs for each date.
